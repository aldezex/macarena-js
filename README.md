# Why Macarena?

Well, Macarena is one of my two dogs. MacarenaJS is a web framework that I'm developing basically to learn how a web framework works.
It's not going to be the fastest or the most secure framework, but it's going to be here, and Macarena will be proud of it, and she will be remembered forever.

# What is MacarenaJS?

It's just a frontend web framework. Very similar to the first versions of ReactJS.

# What about the other dog?

The other dog is Batata. She is not a framework, but she is a compiler: [Batata](http://github.com/aldezex/batata). The initial idea was to create a compiler that parses JS into Rust, but maybe I'll change it in the future to a compiler that parses "JSX" into the MacarenaJS hyperscript.

# How to use it?

TODO (I'm still developing it) ðŸ˜„
